### Hi, my name is Jakub Szymkowiak 🙋‍♂️

🎓 I am a graduate student in both Mathematics (Statistics) and Data Analysis & Data Processing at the Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań. 
Before that, I studied at the University of Warsaw, where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics. 

You're welcome to visit [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakubszymkowiak/).

🛠️ My technical skills include:

- Data Science: data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, statistical modeling (``Python``, ``R``, ``Tableau``)
- Machine Learning: budiling predictive models, feature selection, model selection, unsupervised learning (``Python``)
- Relational Databases: ``PostgreSQL``, ``T-SQL``
- Misc: principles of functional programming (``Scala``) 

However, being a mathematician, I very much enjoy the theoretical foundations of the field (statistics, deep learning theory) as well.
